         * Here is a list of the predefined functional interfaces in Java:
         *
         * 1. `Supplier<T>`: Represents a supplier of results.
         *
         * 2. `Consumer<T>`: Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
         *
         * 3. `BiConsumer<T, U>`: Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
         *
         * 4. `Predicate<T>`: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
         *
         * 5. `BiPredicate<T, U>`: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of two arguments.
         *
         * 6. `Function<T, R>`: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
         *
         * 7. `BiFunction<T, U, R>`: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
         *
         * 8. `UnaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand.
         *
         * 9. `BinaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
         *
         * 10. `Supplier<T>`: Represents a supplier of results.
         *
         * 11. `Consumer<T>`: Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
         *
         * 12. `BiConsumer<T, U>`: Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
         *
         * 13. `Predicate<T>`: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
         *
         * 14. `BiPredicate<T, U>`: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of two arguments.
         *
         * 15. `Function<T, R>`: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.

         *
         * 17. `UnaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand.
         *
         * 18. `BinaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
         *
         * 19. `Predicate<T>`: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
         *
         * 20. `BiPredicate<T, U>`: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of two arguments.
         *
         * 21. `Function<T, R>`: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
         *
         * 22. `BiFunction<T, U, R>`: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
         *
         * 23. `UnaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand.
         *
         * 24. `BinaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
         *

         *
         * 27. `Function<T, R>`: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
         *
         * 28. `BiFunction<T, U, R>`: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
         *
         * 29. `UnaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand.
         *
         * 30. `BinaryOperator<T>`: Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
         *
         * These functional interfaces provide a way to represent lambda expressions or method references,
         * allowing them to be used in functional programming and stream processing in Java.
